# Endless Runner Project

A quick fun endless runner I developed as a projet for a Game Scirpting class.

This was developed in Unity personal, and is not meant for profit

if you want to play the game, download the builds folder and run the application (application will only work with the data folder in the same locations as the application).

to edit in unity create a new unity project, then download the materials, music, prefabs, scenes and Scripts folders into your projects assets folders. Also replace your projects ProjectSettings with the one from here. 

Enjoy!
