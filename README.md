# Endless-Runner-Project
# This is an endless runner game I developed in Unity for my game scripting class in DePaul University. This is currently only workable as a desktop app, where I want to continue to improve on it in order for it to be playable as a mobile app as well. The game is functional but simple, I also want to make it more user friendly, add instructions etc. 
# All scripts except the camera follow and tile generator were scripted by me, where the tile generator and camera follow were scripted by my proffesor William Meyers from DePaul University.
# This was developed in Unity personal, and is not meant for profit
# if you want to play the game, download the application file in the builds folder.
# to edit in unity download open a new unity project, then download the materials, music, prefabs, scenes and Scripts folders into your projects assets folders. Also replace your projects ProjectSettings with the one from here.
